Load inductor is filter to load current as minimizing sharpness. If inductivity increases, observe DC current at load. 
At full bridge rectifier, if load current is like constant value, line current is observed like square wave.
All of them shows us that indcutive load behaves like constant current source at steady state. 

Note: There is no effect on 'commutation'. 
Commutation depends on source side inductance, not load side.
