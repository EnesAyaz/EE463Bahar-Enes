Simulink is an quite useful digital simulation environment for making simulations of dynamic systems. It computes successive states at time steps. The methods are included in 'solver'. 
Our solver is discrete and has fixed-step which means that time step is constant from beginning to end of simulation.

The step size, the sampling interval, depends on the 'time constant' of circuit. There is a basic rule that the sampling time should be the 1/10 times of the time constant.

We used powergui block to make the arrangements for the simulation. We have chosen discrete as the simulation type and simulate the circuit for different values of sample time.


We observe that 1.5 msec time step was not realistic. It resulted in disturbances in the load voltage.
However, 10usec and 1usec was appliable for the circuit since they give more smooth and expected output waveforms relative to the 
1.5 msec case.
This is because, when our sampling time is not small enough, some of the time steps are lost. Hence, we have some information lost at the
resultant output voltage waveform.
