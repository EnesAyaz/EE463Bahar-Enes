Simulink is useful for making dynamic system simulation.It computes successive states at time steps. The methods are included in 'solver'. 
Our solver has fixed-step that means that time step is constant from beginning to end of simulation.

The step size, sampling interval, depends on 'time constant' of circuit.There is basic rule that sampling time is 1/10 times time constant.

We observe that 1.5 msec time step is not realistic. However, 10usec and 1usec is appliable for the circuit.
